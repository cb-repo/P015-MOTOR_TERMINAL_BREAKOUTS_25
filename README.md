<img src="assets/MOTOR_TERMINAL_BREAKOUT_25mm.png" width="500">

Motor terminals are traditionally small and flimsy, making it hard to guarantee a reliable solder connection.
MOTOR TERMINAL BREAKOUTS are designed to simplify and strengthen these solder joints, enabling more reliable operation especally in high vibration environments: orignially designed for combat robotics but is suitable for any application using these motors.
